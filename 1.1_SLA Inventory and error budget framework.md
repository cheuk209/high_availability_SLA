SLA Inventory and error budget framework

Description
As an SRE team member,

I need a comprehensive inventory of all SLAs and a standardized method to convert them into practical error budgets,

so that we can properly understand and manage our availability commitments.



Acceptance Criteria:
Complete document listing all current SLAs by service, including uptime percentages and response time commitments
Formula documented for translating percentage-based SLAs into time-based error budgets (e.g., 99.9% = 43.2 minutes/month)
Error budget calculation includes monthly, quarterly, and annual views
Document is reviewed by Service Delivery team and stored in a central repository
SLA document includes planned maintenance windows and how they affect calculations
